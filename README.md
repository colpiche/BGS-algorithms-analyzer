# BGS's algorithms analyzer

A tool to compute statistics on the accuracy of different background substraction algorithms.

These algorithms perform foreground-background separation in videos for the purpose of automatic movement detection.

All foreground masks in this repo were obtained using BGSLibrary : https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary
